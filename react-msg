==> React is a JavaScript Library for building user interfaces. In contrast to React,
    we have other tools like `Angular` and `Vue` which are Frameworks. The difference
    between a Library and a Framework is that, A Library is a tool that provides specific 
    functionality, While a Framework is just set of tools and guidelines for building apps.

To Create a React Component
    - create a file for our next React component using TypeScript
    - Give it an extension 'ts' or 'tsx'.`ts` is used when we want to write plain TypeScript and `tsx` is used when we want to write a React component using TypeScript
    - There two ways to create a React Component:
        * Using JavaScript class
        * Using JavaScript function ✔️
    We use the JSX syntax in our React component;
        function Message() {
            return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>; 
        }
    One of the great things of JSX is that;
        * It allows us to easily create `dynamic` content. For Example;
           function Greeting() {
                const name = "Miracle";
                return <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>; 
            }
            Even a `function` can be passed, in fact anything that can return a value
            can be passed dynamically.
        * A conditional statement can also be used within the scope of the function. 
        * Note: In React a Component can not return more than one element. 
            A way to resolve this issue is to import `Fragment` from react and
                use the tag to wrap the component.
            This can also be resolved by wrapping our component witj an empty tag that
            both opens and closes(`<></>`)
        * In JSX we do not have the "for" loop to help us loop through the elements
            in an array instead we use another technique. In an Array we have a method called 
           `map` which enables us to convert or map each item to an item of different type.
